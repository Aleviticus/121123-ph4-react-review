# Phase 4 React Refresher

## Learning Goals

- Props

- useState

- Controlled Inputs / Forms

- useEffect

- Fetch GET and POST

- React Router

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this repository. Begin by running:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To run the json-server run this command:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```

Some things have already been built for you such as the router provider (we'll go over this).

To begin, we'll change the db.json to be tailored to a project of your choice. From there build out an index page to show all items and then a form to `POST` a new item.
